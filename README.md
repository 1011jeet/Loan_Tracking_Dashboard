Loan Analytics Dashboard ‚Äì React + Mock API üí∏

This is a self-initiated mini project built as part of my application for the GoodLeap Software Engineering Internship. I used this as a way to practice working with REST APIs, understand frontend-backend interaction, and simulate a basic internal tool used in fintech settings.

Built in ~5 hours, this dashboard allows users to:
- View and filter customer loans by status (Approved, Pending, Rejected)
- See summary metrics like total loans, approved loan sum, and average loan size
- Work with a mock backend using JSON Server

Note: This is not a production-grade project ‚Äî it's a personal learning sprint.

Tech Stack:
- React (Vite)
- Axios
- JSON Server (for mock API)
- HTML/CSS

Features:
- Table view of customer loans
- Dropdown filter by loan status
- Dynamic summary metrics: total loans, sum of approved loan amounts, average loan size
- Status-based colour indicators (e.g., green for Approved, orange for Pending, red for Rejected)
- Local mock backend integration

How to Run:

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   git clone https://github.com/1011jeet/Loan_Tracking_Dashboard.git
   cd Loan_Tracking_Dashboard
   npm install

2. Start the mock API server:
   npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3001

3. Start the React frontend-> Open a different terminal and run:
   npm run dev


Sample Loan Object:
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Alice",
  "amount": 50000,
  "status": "Approved",
  "loan_date": "2024-11-01"
}
