<h1 align="center">Welcome to Loan Analytics Mock App – RESTful Dashboard 👋</h1>
<p>
</p>

> This is a self-initiated mini project built to practice working with REST APIs and develop a better understanding of frontend-backend interaction using React and JSON Server.

### 🏠 [Homepage](It simulates a basic loan tracking dashboard like what might exist in a fintech internal tool — letting you filter by loan status, view summaries like total/approved loans, and explore user-level data.)

### ✨ [Demo](Built over ~5 hours as a personal learning sprint. Not meant for production use — just a sandbox to apply API calls,  and basic logic.)

## Install

```sh
1. Start the mock APIIn your project root, 
    run:   "npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3001"
2. Start the React app
    In another terminal, run:  " npm run dev"
```
